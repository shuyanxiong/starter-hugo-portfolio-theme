When envisioning the future of architecture, we tend to gravitate towards innovative technologies, new materials and advanced methods. However, there is also a powerful natural material embedded in our modern advances: earth.

Historically, earthen materials have been at the heart of human shelter. From our earliest dwellings to grand earthen structures, it is perhaps the oldest building technique in the world. However, with the rise of modern urban architecture, materials such as concrete, steel, wood and brick have overtaken earth. This raises a crucial question: why do we dig up earth only to discard it and replace it with energy-intensive materials?

The sustainable attributes of earth are manifold:

- **Cost-effectiveness and resource conservation:** Using excavated materials for construction breaks the cycle of mining and transportation of materials such as sand and gravel. This not only saves costs, but also protects our depleting natural resources.

- **Natural climate regulation:** Earthen buildings have an innate ability to regulate indoor humidity. The Triemli Hospital in Zurich, for example, utilizes earthen plaster in combination with modern building systems to achieve a balanced indoor environment.

- **Meeting modern challenges:** The depletion of high-quality sand from rivers and lakes poses a major threat to the construction industry. However, there is still a great deal of earth available where buildings rise up from the ground.

However, challenges remain. Traditional earthen construction techniques must evolve with the times to meet the requirements of modern buildings. This has prompted researchers around the world to work on improving the performance of earthen materials. From developing slurries with superior moisture-regulating properties to creating liquid soils that perform similarly to traditional concrete, researchers have made various efforts in this regard.

As we find ourselves at the intersection of modernization and sustainability, a compelling avenue emerges as we re-evaluate and innovate with clay. The Regenerative Laboratory of the Chair of Sustainable Construction at ETH Zurich has delved into a variety of techniques to explore the potential of clay materials. From experimenting with casting techniques with a variety of additives to studying rammed earth with different aggregate compositions, our efforts aim to achieve various goals, such as enhancing water resistance through tannins, speeding up production through pouring, or increasing strength through geopolymers. Presented here are some samples of earth bricks designed to illustrate their marketable solutions in the construction industry.

## Spotlight on the Samples:

- **Marketability:** not only are these earth bricks produced by pouring techniques, but they also utilize a concrete-like production process, which offers the advantages of easy production, quick entry into service, and a similar appearance to traditional bricks. In addition to these advantages, they are also environmentally friendly. The technique involves utilizing the inorganic components of the excavated soil, compressing it, and stabilizing it with a very small amount of cement or lime.

- **Versatility:** clay mixtures are customizable and different pigments can be added to match your design preferences. The loose structure of clay gives it excellent moisture regulating properties, allowing for uses beyond building materials. This adaptable material helps to naturally regulate the indoor climate.

- **Flexibility:** notably, the material can be poured into molds similar to those used for traditional concrete, which revolutionizes the application process by being fast and versatile to produce. This not only meets market demand, but also significantly reduces construction costs.

These samples showcase the immense potential of earth as a construction material. By combining traditional knowledge with modern techniques, we pave the way for more sustainable and eco-friendly building solutions.

For those interested in the vast potential of earthen construction, embracing and promoting these techniques may pave the way for a greener, more sustainable built landscape. Feel free to check our website and reach out at [ETH Zurich Sustainable Construction](https://sc.ibi.ethz.ch/en/).
