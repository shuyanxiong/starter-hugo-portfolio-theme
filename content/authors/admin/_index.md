I am Shuyan Xiong, a Ph.D. student at the Chair of Sustainable Construction since January 2022. My academic journey began at McGill University, where I pursued a B.Eng. in Honours Mechanical Engineering from 2014 to 2018, graduating with Distinction. In 2021, I earned my M.Sc. in Integrated Building Systems from ETH Zurich's Department of Architecture.

During my master's studies, I served as a lab assistant at Digital Building Technologies (DBT, ETHZ), specializing in polymer 3D-printing. Under the guidance of A/S Group and DBT, my master's thesis, "Optimization of infill structures for high-performance 3D-printed building facades," honed my parametric modeling and performance analysis skills.

My research focus revolves around material sourcing description for digitally-enabled circular economies. My passion for sustainable construction and future circular cities drove me to join the chair and actively contribute to our ongoing projects.
