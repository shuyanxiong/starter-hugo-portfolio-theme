## Introduction

In our recent study, "Environmental savings from concrete reuse: examining the limitations and optimal practices for cutting thresholds of concrete building components for reuse," we tackle a crucial question in sustainable construction: How small can we cut concrete pieces while still saving greenhouse gas emissions?

## Key Findings

Our research yielded several important insights:

- We developed a mathematical model to investigate GHG emissions associated with preparing concrete for reuse.
- We established a screening standard for determining the minimum cutting size for concrete reuse.
- We found that the ratio of transportation distances (reuse case vs. new production) influences the minimum cutting size.
- We demonstrated that cutting size significantly impacts overall GHG emissions in the reuse strategy.

## Practical Implications

Our research offers practical insights for industry stakeholders to optimize concrete reuse practices and effectively reduce GHG emissions. We've also developed a tool prototype to guide professionals in optimizing cutting sizes for concrete reuse.
