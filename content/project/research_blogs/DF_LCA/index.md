üåç **Successful LCA Discussion Forum on Circular Construction**

We were pleased to co-host a dynamic discussion forum on **‚ÄúReduction of Building Embodied Impacts: Circular Construction‚Äù**, co-organized by *Shuyan Xiong (Chair of Sustainable Construction, ETH)* and *Carlo Schmid (Chair of Ecological Systems Design, ETH)*.

With engaging presentations and thought-provoking discussions, the event brought together researchers and practitioners to explore how circular strategies can reduce environmental impacts in the building sector.

üí° **Key takeaways:**  
- *Circular ‚â† automatically sustainable* ‚Äî we need to critically evaluate circular solutions.  
- *Digitalization* opens up powerful opportunities for data-driven decisions in construction.  
- *Greater collaboration and standardization* across stakeholders is essential.

Thank you to all contributors for sharing their insights!
